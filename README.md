Have fun!


This repository enhances the source code by incorporating attention mechanisms, guided filtering for noise reduction, and loss function optimization. These improvements address issues such as color bias and noise generation in highlighted areas, leading to enhanced PSNR, SSIM, and reduced MAE compared to the original network.
